# Testing

Thanks to the "GitHub Pages" option on the GitHub website everybody can reach my website with clicking on the [link](https://istvangercsak.github.io/PlaceFinder-SecondMilestoneProject/)

I prefer the GitHub Pages option instead of the Cloud9 because it is stable and available 24/7.

**Test types:**
- Manual tests
    - Non-Functional tests
        - **Usability:** Usability testing is a technique used in user-centered interaction design to evaluate a product by testing it on users. 
        This can be seen as an irreplaceable usability practice, since it gives direct input on how real users use the system. 
        Shortly: The ease of use and learn to use the website
        - **Reliability:** Reliability testing is defined as a software testing type, that checks whether the software can 
        perform a failure-free operation for a specified period of time in a specified environment. 
            - Stable and consistent result
            - I will get the same result even if I search for the place on Pc, Tablet or Mobile Phone.
            - See test cases under the "Responsive" section 
- [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) validator:
    - With these validator I was ensured that after the scanning this code it does not shows me any detected errors.
